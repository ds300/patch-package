Moving fast and breaking things. It turns out yarn doesn't run the prepare hook
after removing a package, so we use patch-package to patch a local version of
yarn. I'm not proud of this. Probably wouldn't have released this in the first
place if I had known that yarn didn't have all the right hooks. Oh well. Now I
have a reason to contribute to Yarn I guess.
