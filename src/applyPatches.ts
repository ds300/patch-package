  Don't worry! This is probably fine. The patch was still applied
  successfully. Here's the deets:

  Patch file created for

    ${packageName}@${chalk.bold(originalVersion)}

  applied to

    ${packageName}@${chalk.bold(actualVersion)}
  
  At path
  
    ${path}

  This warning is just to give you a heads-up. There is a small chance of
  breakage even though the patch was applied successfully. Make sure the package
  still behaves like you expect (you wrote tests, right?) and then run

    ${chalk.bold(`patch-package ${pathSpecifier}`)}

  to update the version in the patch file name and make this warning go away.

  This error was caused because patch-package cannot apply the following patch file:

    patches/${patchFileName}

  Try removing node_modules and trying again. If that doesn't work, maybe there was
  an accidental change made to the patch file? Try recreating it by manually
  editing the appropriate files and running:
  
    patch-package ${pathSpecifier}
  
  If that doesn't work, then it's a bug in patch-package, so please submit a bug
  report. Thanks!

  This error was caused because ${chalk.bold(packageName)} has changed since you
  made the patch file for it. This introduced conflicts with your patch,
  just like a merge conflict in Git when separate incompatible changes are
  made to the same piece of code.

  Maybe this means your patch file is no longer necessary, in which case
  hooray! Just delete it!

  Otherwise, you need to generate a new patch file.

  To generate a new one, just repeat the steps you made to generate the first
  one.

  i.e. manually make the appropriate file changes, then run 

    patch-package ${pathSpecifier}

  Info:
    Patch file: patches/${patchFileName}
    Patch was made for version: ${chalk.green.bold(originalVersion)}
    Installed version: ${chalk.red.bold(actualVersion)}
